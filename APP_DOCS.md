## **Introduction**

This document outlines the planning and requirements for developing a secure, cross-platform password manager application using Flutter. The application aims to provide users with a secure means to create, store, copy, update, and share usernames, passwords, and notes about websites or applications without relying on internet connectivity. It emphasizes local storage and strong security features to protect sensitive data.

---

## **Core Architecture**

### **Local Storage**

- **Database**: Utilize **SQLite** for secure local data storage across platforms.
- **File-Based Encryption**: Implement encryption for all stored data, ensuring that the database is encrypted at rest.
- **No Internet Connectivity**: All data management occurs offline to enhance security.
- **Local Backups**: Support manual backups via the local file system, allowing users to export and import data securely.

### **Security Implementation**

- **Encryption Standard**: Use **AES-256** encryption for data security.
- **Key Derivation Function (KDF)**: Implement **Argon2** for secure key derivation from the master password.
- **Memory Protection**: Employ techniques to protect sensitive data in memory, preventing it from being leaked or compromised.
- **Secure Random Number Generation**: Use platform-specific secure random number generators for tasks like password generation.

---

## **Feature Components**

### **Data Management**

- **Stored Items**:
  - Password entries (usernames and passwords).
  - Secure notes associated with accounts or standalone.
- **Organization**:
  - Categories and tags for organizing entries.
  - Search functionality for easy retrieval.
- **Timestamps**:
  - Each entry includes a `lastModified` timestamp for synchronization and conflict resolution.
- **Version Tracking**:
  - Maintain a history of passwords for each entry, allowing users to view and revert to previous passwords if necessary.

### **Export/Import System**

- **Selective Export**:
  - Allow users to export selected entries or the entire database.
- **Encrypted File Format**:
  - Exported files are encrypted using AES-256 and protected with a passphrase set by the user during export.
- **Passphrase Protection**:
  - Required to decrypt and import data on a new device.
- **Conflict Resolution**:
  - Upon import, the app compares timestamps and prompts the user to resolve any conflicts between existing and imported entries.

### **User Interface**

- **Cross-Platform Design**:
  - Use **Material Design** principles for Android, Windows, and Linux platforms.
- **Responsive Layouts**:
  - Ensure the UI adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and resolutions.
- **Theme Support**:
  - Provide both dark and light themes, allowing users to choose based on their preferences.
- **Customization**:
  - Intuitive interfaces for password generation settings and other customizable features.

---

## **Security Features**

### **Access Control**

- **Master Password Protection**:
  - The application requires a master password upon startup to unlock access to stored data.
- **Auto-Lock Functionality**:
  - Automatically locks the app after a period of inactivity.
- **Session Management**:
  - Securely manage user sessions, requiring re-authentication when necessary.

### **Data Protection**

- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**:
  - All encryption and decryption occur locally, with no data transmitted over the internet.
- **Secure Clipboard Handling**:
  - When copying sensitive data to the clipboard:
    - Auto-clear the clipboard after a user-defined period.
    - Notify users when the clipboard is cleared.
- **Manual Backups**:
  - Users can manually create encrypted backups of their data.
- **Secure Deletion**:
  - Implement secure deletion methods to overwrite data before deletion, where feasible.
- **Password History**:
  - Maintain a history of previous passwords with timestamps for each entry.

---

## **Updated Requirements and Considerations**

### **Data Synchronization and Time Stamps**

- **Entry Timestamps**:
  - Each entry includes a `lastModified` timestamp in ISO 8601 format.
- **Manual Data Transfer**:
  - Users manually transfer encrypted export files to other devices.
- **Conflict Handling**:
  - During import, the app detects conflicts based on timestamps and prompts users to resolve them, providing options to:
    - Keep the existing entry.
    - Overwrite with the imported entry.
    - Merge information if applicable.

### **Secure Export/Import with Passphrase Protection**

- **Export Process**:
  - Users set a passphrase during export, which is used to encrypt the exported file.
  - The file is encrypted using AES-256 with a key derived from the passphrase via Argon2 KDF.
- **Import Process**:
  - Requires the passphrase to decrypt the imported file.
  - Verifies the data integrity before importing.
  - Handles incorrect passphrases gracefully with clear error messages.
- **Security Considerations**:
  - No time limitations on exported files to avoid issues with device clock discrepancies.
  - Emphasizes the importance of using strong passphrases for exports.

### **Password Generation Customization**

- **Customizable Options**:
  - Password length.
  - Inclusion of uppercase letters.
  - Inclusion of lowercase letters.
  - Inclusion of numbers.
  - Inclusion or exclusion of symbols.
  - Exclusion of specific characters (e.g., ambiguous characters like 'l' and '1').
- **Passphrase Generation**:
  - Option to generate passphrases using secure word lists (e.g., EFF's Diceware list).
  - Customizable number of words.
  - Choice of separators (spaces, hyphens, etc.).
- **User Interface**:
  - Intuitive UI with toggles, checkboxes, and sliders for setting preferences.
- **Password Strength Indicator**:
  - Visual indicator showing the strength of the generated password based on selected criteria.

### **Clipboard Management**

- **Auto-Clear Clipboard**:
  - Sensitive data copied to the clipboard is cleared after a user-defined interval (e.g., 30 seconds).
- **User Notifications**:
  - Users are notified when data is copied to the clipboard and when it is cleared.
- **Security Considerations**:
  - Inform users about potential risks of clipboard data being accessed by other applications.

### **Backups**

- **Manual Backups**:
  - Users can initiate backups manually from the app's settings.
- **Backup Encryption**:
  - Backups are encrypted using the master password or a separate backup passphrase.
- **Restore Process**:
  - Guided process to restore data from a backup, preventing accidental data overwrites.

### **Secure Deletion and Password History**

- **Secure Deletion**:
  - Overwrite deleted data with random data before deletion, where feasible.
  - Recognize limitations due to hardware and file system constraints.
- **Password History**:
  - Store previous passwords along with timestamps for each entry.
  - Allow users to view and manage password history.
  - Accessing password history requires authentication.

### **Cross-Platform Testing in Flutter**

- **Platform-Specific Features**:
  - Acknowledge that some features may require platform-specific implementations.
- **Testing Plan**:
  - Allocate resources for testing on all target platforms (Windows, Linux, Android).
- **Flutter Plugins**:
  - Use reputable Flutter plugins for handling secure storage, file access, and other platform-specific functionalities.
- **Continuous Integration**:
  - Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing across platforms.
